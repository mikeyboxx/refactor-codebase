# Refactor codebase that follows accessibilty standards

## Description

Currently the production site uses non-semantic HTML tags and does not follow accessibility standards. In addition, the CSS file is not structured properly and contains repeating code. 

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessible sites are better positioned in search engines and help to avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.

The codebase was refactored without changing the functionality or the appearance to make it more accessible.
